## Course desc

> What will we learn in the course?
"parallel and distributed computing portion"
"high performance computing, operating systems, and modern parallel architecture."

## Course portions
1. data structures -- linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
1. algorithms. - searching and sorting algos -- and analysis.
1. parallel & distributed computing -- parallel alos, and hardware.

"in class demos"
"lab asignments"
> What will the lab component look like?
> What kind of group work will we be doing?
"discussion sessions"
> What form will this take? What skills will this help us develop?

"Learning goals"

- "improve your programming skills in C#"
- "work collaboratively in teams."
- "speed up applications using parallel software and hardware"
> Does this mean concurrency? Multi-threading, GPU and batch acceleration etc.?

> What is a data structure?
> What are the most important tools for analyzing algorithms?
> searching alos
- lists, stacks, queues
- seque sorting -- bubble sort, selectio sort, insertion sort, merge sort, heap sort, quick sort
> What are the most important sorting algorithms?
- tree, binary, graphs and graph algos
- hash tables, generic & non-generic "collection classes"
- "implement generic classes" 
> What is a generic class?
- implement graphs
- compare data structures
- "discuss various social and ethical issues related to software development"
- differences between threads and processes
> What is a thread? What is a process? What is the difference bettween a thread and a proces? What is the difference between a thread and a daemon? Which of these is a Go routine?
- types of parallel harware:
    - multi-core
    - vector procesor
    - multi-processor

- "parallel algorithmic patterns"
> what kinds of parallel algos are there?

- "practice this in several programming environments: pthreads, OpenMP, OpenACC, and MPI"
- "debug parallel programs, finding race conditions and fixing them."

> What is a race condition?
> What if I wrote a script that would integrate with my qs script in a way that
> When I hit it, it opens a new file with a page full of the qs and then open lines below them, and I can answer them and it stores the answers in a folder and that way I can circle back to the quesions I had before and refine my understanding of the underlying material.

> What are programming environments? What is the difference between a programming environment, an IDE, a runtime, etc... Is an environment just a set of environment variables and language tools?

> What kinds of group work will we be doing in the course?

## Schedule

> What are the covid safety protocols that we will observe during in-person sessions?

"Richard's grading policy:"
- quizzes (highest),
- labs,
- weekly reflections,
- written assignments,
- programming assignments


> Will there be a math component to the course?
> What if any upper division science credit is possible?

- 6 credits Data Structures  
- 4 credits Parallel programming 
- 4 credits Algorithms 
- 1 credits Cracking the Coding Interview 
- 1 credits Seminar on Current issues and problems in Computer Science

> How many hours are there in a work week? 64 hours a week, then the dist is roughly
> 64 * 6/16 = 24 hours of data structures -- about 3.4 hours per day.
> 64 * 4/16 = 16 hours of parallel programming -- 2.3 hours per day.
> 64 * 4/16 = 16 hours of algos -- 2.3 hours per day.
> 64 * 1/16 = 4 hours of cracking the coding interview -- 0.6 hours per day.
> 64 * 1/16 = 4 hours of seminar on current issues & problems in CS -- 0.6 hours per day.




"Maintain an organized portfolio of your work"
"including programs that you write."
"Your complete electronic portfolio is due by noon on the friday of week 10."
"Write a detailed, thoughtful self-evaluation"
