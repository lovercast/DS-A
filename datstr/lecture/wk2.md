# Data Structures Lecture 2



Most omportant data structures
tradeoffs -- what are my goals --

space vs time -- use more memory to run faster -- make program more optimal for memory, slow down -- how would I implement a space time trace off?


Measure the effectiveness of a data structure or algorithm
Big O

Data is growing as hardware is improving
minimize consumption of power -- cell phones and mobile computing need to be power efficient

array lists, linked lists, queues, binary trees, graphs, ...

commonly used methods for all data structures

traversing
searching 
insertion
deletion
sorting
merging -- how is this different from merge sort


What is a data structure?


Hands on in class -- array list -- what is the definition of an array list.

Dynamic array? What is the difference 
integer arrays in c# have zeroed memory --  in C#
