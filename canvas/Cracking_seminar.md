Goals: become familiar with strings as an ordered set of characters and arrays in C#, strengthen skills working in teams.

First 10 minutes: logistics.  You'll get to work in teams of three. You should choose

one member that keeps track of time and reads the problems out loud for the team,
one member that types in the code, and
one member that will talk about your work when we reconvene with the entire class. 
*if for some reason you have a fourth member, this member should be in charge of helping the team with checking out resources (textbooks, google, etc.) as needed by the team.  
Note: "Cracking the Coding Interview [...]" book contains hints, as well as solutions (but not written in C#). You may use them, but I would prefer if you would come up with your own way of solving these questions.

For the next 40 minutes, you'll get to work (in teams of three) on the following problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview [...]" book. You must use C# to solve these problems. If you do not finish all these problems, that's OK.

Problem 1 - Is Unique (page 90): Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

Problem 2 - Check Permutation (page 90): Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation (anagram) of the other.

Problem 3 - String Compression (page 91): Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

 

Break for 10 minutes.

 

For the next 30 minutes: continue working on the problems given above. If you finish early, feel free to try any other problem from the same page/chapter as the problems given above.

 

For the next 20 minutes, we'll reconvene all together and analyze your work. Each group will have their representative talk about their work and how they approached these problems. 

 

Last 10 minutes of the class will be reserved for questions and answers. Also, please submit your code and include (as a comment) the name of each member of the team. If your code is incomplete, it's OK. Use this lab as an interview exercise.
