The goal for this lab is to write a C program that uses pthreads correctly. Specific objectives include: 

decompose an array into appropriate-sized pieces for each pthread,
write a correct search function,
allocate space for the pthreads,
call the pthread create function,
pass parameters correctly to the pthread create function,
collaborate with teammates, e.g. ask or answer a question, share code
practice iterative refinement of code
What you will do:

Write a program using pthreads to search an array in parallel. The command line arguments should be: the number of threads and the length of the random array of ints to search. The value to search for should be read from the keyboard.

The array is generated by the program from the random number generator. You can download and modify the countElems_p.c program in section 14.3, instead of writing everything from scratch. You may not finish writing your code during this lab, so it is an opportunity to practice iterative refinement, i.e. start by writing a program that has some of the  features specified, but not all. 

What you will turn in:
