Data Structures -- hands on coding experience

Lectures are RECORDED!

__Richard__'s interests
reinforcement learning
computer vision
cybersecurtiy

teaching parallel and distributed computing

__Razvan__ -- background in software engineering
background in mathematics and computer science
student at Georgia tech


quick presentation of canvas -- 
slides and hands on practice

lots of hands on coding in class

10-12 first class

Tuesday in person -- optionally at home

monday, thursday -  remote
tuesday - in person -- in the computer center -- group work

two lab spaces -- zoom open
groups for people working in zoom

mixing zoom and in person is difficult


cracking the coding interview segment -- experience working in groups with
time pressure to solve algorithm problems -- specifically job interview type
questions.

submit different code -- don't copy code -- group solutions, but submit individual code

data structures and algorithms week 1 lab

reading strings from console and indexing characters
while loops
for loops
random number generator
writing to a file

count or display the number of
for labs write about what you learned -- for homework actually work on the fcode

so labs don't have a submitted code portion

copying other people's code -- problems with licensing and sharing

submitting production code -- need to have the copyright

====================================================================


parallel programming -- what kind of programming environment?
