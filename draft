Hello Richard!

Happy to be working with you again.

I just read the syllabus for Data Structures and Algorithms and I had a few questions to bounce off you.

What COVID safety protocols will we be observing during the in-person sessions? I'm aware of the immunitzation proof requirement and the daily health verifications. Are there any other measures that I should be prepared for?

How much of the course do you evision being group work? I haven't attended any classes at Evergreen since COVID. Do you have any experience with what makes for successful group work in a mostly Zoom/social distance-oriented environment?

Which of the course credits are upper division science credits? All, including Cracking the Coding Interview and Seminar, or if not, what opportunities do we have to earn upper division credit in those portions?

To what extent [will|can] our work in DS&A integrate with the work in Student Originated Software? Do you view them as potentially linked, or as completely freestanding courses?

Thank You,
Levi Overcast
