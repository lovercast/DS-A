# Lab 2 Parallel & Distributed Computing

Since most of you didn't get to use pthreads last week, we will do that this week

What you will do:

1. Write a program using pthreads to multiply each element in an array by a constant. The command line arguments should be: the number of threads and the length of the random array of ints and the value to multiply the array by. Note that when configuring your VM, you will need to set the number of cores to be more than 1 in order to see a speedup, assuming your hardware has multiple cores.

The array is generated by the program from the random number generator. You can download and modify the countElems_p.c program in section 14.3, instead of writing everything from scratch. You may not finish writing your code during this lab, so it is an opportunity to practice iterative refinement, i.e. start by writing a program that has some of the  features specified, but not all. 

2. Download the CountSort program in 14.3, repeat the timing experiments described in the text, including the timing using gettimeofday from time.h. Also try the experiments using pthread_mutex_lock() and unlock.

What you will turn in:

Answer the following questions in the text entry box:

who was on your team?
what did you accomplish?
what did you learn?
what questions do you have?
Navigate to Discussions. Reply to the Discussion Labeled Lab 1 and upload what code you have written.
