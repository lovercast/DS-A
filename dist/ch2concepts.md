# Chapter 2 Key concepts

- von Neumann architecture
- central processing uniit
- main memory
- von Neumann bottleneck
CPU clock speed is far faster than the data transfer over the FSB.
- operating system
- multi-tasking
- process
A routine being executed by the CPU. A process has an ID, a parent, and children. A process may be composed of multple running threads.
- thread
A single flow of execution competing for CPU time. A thread has a call stack, a heap, and instructions that it executes.
> Does a thread have a heap?
> What's the difference between a process and a thread?
- caches
- blocks
- lines
> What's the difference between a cache block and a cache line?
- cache hit/miss
- virtual memory
- swap space
- pages
- virtual addresses
- page tables
- translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
- Instruction-level parallelism (ILP)
- pipelining
- multiple ssue
- hardware multithreading 
- stalls 
- simultaneous multithreading
- thread-level parallelism
- coarser-grained
- SPMD
- embarassingly parallel
- load balancing
- communication and synchronization
- private & shared memoryshared variables
- nondeterminism
- race condition
- critical section
- mutual exclusion
- mutex
- thread safety
- message-passing
- send & receive
- block
- Message-Passing Interface (MPI)
- one-sided communications
- partitioned global address Space
- linear speedup
- Amdahl's law
- Scalability (strin & weak)
- wall clock
- Foster's methodology
- Partitoning
- communication
- agglomeration
- aggregation
- Mapping
