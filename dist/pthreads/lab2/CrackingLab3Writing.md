Six expectations of an evergreen grad.

- diverse community, group work *
- interdisciplinary connections *
- demonstrate depth and breadth of learning *
- assume responsibility for own work
- demonstrate critical thinking skills
- communicate creatively and effectively

2 paragraphs about how I've met the expectations.

In Evergreen's diverse community I learned to work collaboratively and effectively in a team setting.
Working among diverse people effectively presents several challenges. You have to listen to the voices of everyone on your team.
You have to uplift the voices of people with historically marginalized identities. You have to contribute constructive feedback
to everyone and also constantly seek feedback on your ideas, reflect, improve and iterate. You have to champion your ideas
when you believe you are right and you have to champion others when you believe they are right.

My work at Evergreen has been excellent preparation to confront all of these challenges and to work effectively with a diverse group
of people and deliver working software on time. For example my work in the Data Structures and Algorithms course was largely 
collaborative. We were given algorithmic problems to solve in groups and although it was challenging, I found that I thrived under the team setting.

My work at evergreen also prepared me for highly interdisciplinary work environment. I trained not to see problems from an isoalted framework, 
but to see the connections between many problem spaces and draw from the experience of other disciplines to synthesize creative and efficient solutions.

Finally, my work at evergreen critical thinking, depth and breadth of learning, creativity and curiosity in a way that I believe has prepared me well for 
work in graduate school and in industry. Evergreen's core expectations for graduates emphasize creativity and critical thinking. I learned to constantly 
evaluate my progress toward my goals. I learned to constantly extend my work because doing the assigned work is never enough. For example through my 
expeeriments with the concepts learned in class, I teach myself new things, confronting problems and questions that I have about the material, 
and as a result of simulating, measuring, or breaking something, I gain a new and stronger understanding of the underlying concepts and at the same time, 
practice the skills of a scientist, engineer, artist, or other creative person.
