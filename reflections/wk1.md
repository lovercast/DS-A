I'm very happy with the first week in this course!

I think I've learned a lot about

I think I've pusehd myself to work harder, to find my limits and test them. I put a fair amount of work into my Lab assignments, my written homework and writing a guide to installing a Virtual Machine on windows. 

I think I've learned a lot about parallelism, processes/threads, computer memory, and models of parallel and concurrent programming. I've spent a fair few hours thinking about it at least.

I feel fairly comfortable in C# at the level we've engaged with it! As of now the uncredited first author on every project I've written in C# is really Visual Studio! In any case the syntax is very C-like and familiar. The modern programming features (generic programming, object orientation etc) are familiar enough and there are plenty of useful data structures and functions to learn from.

 

Some Questions I have off the top of my head:

 

What are some projects I can do that will make me more fluent/experienced in modern C#? What are open-source projects in C# that are worth browsing and learning the idioms from? What applications are written in C# that offer a model for development? What are fields of software development in which C# is traditionally underutilized and which of those might be worth exploring for a project?

 

What are the algorithms that are going to be most important for me to understand and internalize, ie. that I should spend days absorbing and implementing. Which ones are less important or globally useful, or are outdated and not worth spending the time to understand and reimplement?

 

What parallel programming paradigms work cross-platform? What parallel programming frameworks are industry standard in high-performance computing? Given what we know about different models of parallel hardware (SIMD, MIMD, vector processors, shared and distributed memory, ...)  how do we as software engineers write code that takes that knowledge into account? 

 

I'm happy with my engagement with the learning community. I noticed that the Windows people in our class were having a very difficult time getting their C code to work natively on their machines. My attitude is that if half the people in the class are drowning in technical problems on day 3, then my learning community isn't functioning properly and that's a big problem for me. So I wrote a guide for people to get a working Ubuntu setup because I have some experience with the Posix/unix/linux stuff and if I can share that with other people and avert some frustration for people, then that will make the learning community more productive and that makes me happy.
